Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat. If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast, as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird. Chicken makes a fantastic substitute for red meats. A great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits.The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.</section></div>
        <div><section class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><h3 id="beef">Beef</h3> Eating protein every day is important, our bodies need it. Proteins supply the building blocks our bodies need (called amino acids) that help us repair and build muscle, bone, skin, hair, cartilage, and more. Daily protein also helps our bodies main our lean body mass, also known as muscle mass. And, of all the nutrients, proteins are very satiating and help make us feel fuller long, preventing unnecessary cravings.Beef is packed with health-promoting amino acids, and it’s one of the single biggest sources of protein in the human diet. For instance, a 6oz (170g) portion of 80% lean beef provides 46g protein. Should we opt for a leaner variety of beef, the protein content increases! That is why at Five Star Home Food, we provide Certified Angus Beef. </section></div>
         <div><section class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>Sushi is rich in Omega3 fish oils, which are classed as essential fats, as the body can’t make them. They have a host of health benefits, including reducing high cholesterol levels, the risk of heart disease and overall inflammation, as well as lowering blood pressure, triglycerides and maintaining heart rhythm.Fish is an excellent source of protein that balances blood sugar and keeps energy levels stable, leading to longer spells of satiety, enhanced metabolism and less snacking between meals, encouraging steady and safe weight loss. Go for ‘fishier’ choices with vegetables like Salmon or Tuna Sashimi with Seaweed Salad, or satisfy your stomach with itsu’s Salmon Threesome.The fish in sushi is the number one brain food! Omega3 fatty acids nourish and repair brain cells and, as fish is also rich in protein and essential fats, it helps focus the mind, increase concentration and maintain energy. So sushi is your perfect aldesko or alfresco lunchtime option at work.</section></div>
